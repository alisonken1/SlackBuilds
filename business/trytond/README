Tryton is a complete ERP. The main features are accounting
(analytic and financial), stock management, sales and purchases management,
POS, etc. Technical features include a distributed server, flexible workflows,
an object database, a dynamic GUI, customizable reports, and SOAP and XML-RPC
interfaces.

Before you can use the tryton server, you will have to set up postgresql. All
you have to do is issue the following command:
  createuser -U postgres --createdb --no-adduser tryton

This will setup trytond for use with postgresql on localhost.  There is
no need to set a password on localhost. However, if you are going to run
postgresql on a different server, you will have to run createuser like this:
  createuser -U postgres --createdb --no-adduser -P tryton

After initializing postgres, modify /etc/trytond/trytond.conf to match your
local setup, then run
    /usr/bin/trytond -c /etc/trytond/trytond.conf -i all

After trytond is setup, then you can run /etc/rc.d/rc.trytond start
